personal medical summary app

The idea behind this app is a database for a person's medical history, tests, etc.  
A clearinghouse for personal medical history
A place to keep basic medical info for initial forms for new doctor signup.
Question: should I keep these two different capabilities separate an combine them later, or
should I make them harmoniously combined from the start.
Ideal or easy?
